The Bob Marley tunes were blasting and he was already feeling the effects of the weed as he pulled out of his driveway and onto the street.

Jimmy giggled uncontrollably at it all.\n\nSince he found the world so amusing in his current state, Jimmy decided he would skip going to the office and just cruise around, seeing where the day took him. At a stoplight he pulled up next to a woman in a red hatchback and stared at her, erupting in laughter. She looked over, saw Jimmy's bloodshot eyes and the joint in his hand, and quickly rolled up her window with an alarmed look. This only made Jimmy laugh even harder.\n\nAfter a few aimless turns, Jimmy ended up at the local park and lay down under a tree, the clouds floating by in trippy formations. His thoughts drifted and he suddenly felt ravenously hungry. On a quest for junk food, Jimmy drove to the nearest fast food drive thru, attempting to order five hamburgers, two orders of fries and three milkshakes. The speaker feedback sounded like an alien language to Jimmy and he rolled down the window and started laughing hysterically at the poor confused teenage cashier.
