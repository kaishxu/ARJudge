You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the responses for a given instruction.
Select the better response, Response 1 or Response 2. The two responses are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.

## Rules of the evaluation:
1. You should prioritize evaluating whether the response honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction.
2. Responses should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such responses do NOT precisely execute the instruction.
3. You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the responses were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Response 1 and Response 2 are **equally likely** to be the better.

## Requirements for your output:
1. You should provide a detailed explanation of your analysis, and then always end your response with either "Therefore, Response 1 is better." or "Therefore, Response 2 is better." verbatim.
2. Do NOT say both/neither are good. Do NOT say "Response 1 is better" or "Response 2 is better" at the beginning.
3. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.

## Instruction:
{instruction}

## Response 1:
{response1}

## Response 2:
{response2}

## Analysis by other evaluators:
{analysis}

## Your analysis (Give a detailed explanation: step 1: what do you think of the analysis by other evaluators?; step 2: can you refine the analysis by reconsidering the requirements of the instruction?; step 3: which response is better?):
